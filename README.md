Tomb Raider 2 Settings
======================

Unofficial tool that allows you to set various options on the game. Not all of them make a lot of sense or are helpful. What may be interesting is the option to set the resolution. Not all options work perfectly or straightforward; play around a bit if you have trouble.

This tool isn't supported by Aspyr. If anything weird happens, simply delete the file

	~/Library/Preferences/com.aspyr.tombraider2.plist

Then the game will revert to its default settings.
